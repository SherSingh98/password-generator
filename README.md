# Password Generator

This is a simple Python script that generates a random password of a specified length. The password includes a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository or download the `password_generator.py` file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `password_generator.py` file is located.

4. Run the script using the following command: python password_generator.py

5. When prompted, enter the desired length of the password.

6. The script will generate a random password of the specified length and display it on the console.

## Example

Enter the desired password length: 12
Generated Password: Py@9!xZ$2mQr

## Customization

If you want to customize the character set used for generating the password, you can modify the `characters` variable in the `generate_password` function. By default, it includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## Security Considerations

- The generated passwords are random and include a mix of different character types, making them strong and difficult to guess.
- However, it's important to note that the security of the password also depends on how it is stored and transmitted. Make sure to follow secure practices when handling and storing passwords.
- Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts or services. It's recommended to use a unique password for each account to minimize the impact of a potential security breach.
